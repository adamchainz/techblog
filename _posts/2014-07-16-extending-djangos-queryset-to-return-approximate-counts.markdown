**UPDATE:** I've re-written and open-sourced a better way of doing the below as
part of my library `django-mysql`.
[The docs there on approximate counting]
(http://django-mysql.readthedocs.org/en/latest/queryset_extensions.html#approximate-counting)
are just as good a read as the below, and you can `pip install` the
solution.

I was looking through the
[MySQL slow_log](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/slow-query-log.html)
for [YPlan](http://yplanapp.com) and discovered that there were a lot of
`SELECT COUNT(*)` queries going on, which take a long time because they require
a full table scan. These were coming from the
[Django admin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/contrib/admin/), which
displays the total count on **every page**.


"Why is `SELECT COUNT(*)` such a slow query?" you might think, "surely MySQL
could just keep a number in the table metadata and update it on INSERT/DELETE."
Aha! You are *totally* right - for the MyISAM storage engine. But Innodb, which
you shoudl be using, provides transacational support and other niceties, at the
cost of making such a metadata count impossible. Each transaction must be
isolated from the others until it commits or rolls back, so a single 'accurate'
`COUNT(*)` value per table is impossible. It would also be a point of
contention from locking, which MyISAM doesn't care about anyway because it
locks the *whole table* for any write. Hence, Innodb `COUNT(*)` = table scan.


Of coures, I wasn't the only one with this problem, and a quick google found me
[this great blog post](http://www.tablix.org/~avian/blog/archives/2011/07/django_admin_with_large_tables/)
by 'Avian' in 2011. This post is my update on that for newer Django versions,
with some extra knowledge I've gained reading up on MySQL.


Here's my take on the code:


```python
class ApproxCountQuerySet(QuerySet):
    """
    Avoid doing COUNT(*) on big tables because it's a full table scan; instead,
    if the table looks big, just extract an approximate count via MySQL's
    EXPLAIN statement.
    """

    def count(self):
        query = self.query
        if (
            not query.where and
            query.high_mark is None and
            query.low_mark == 0 and
            not query.select and
            not query.group_by and
            not query.having and
            not query.distinct
        ):
            cursor = connections[self.db].cursor()
            cursor.execute(
                "/*ApproxCountQuerySet*/ EXPLAIN SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `{}`".format(
                    self.model._meta.db_table
                )
            )
            n = cursor.fetchone()[8]
            if n >= 1000:
                return n

        return super(ApproxCountQuerySet, self).count()
```


A few quick things to point out:


* If the approximate count is not larger than 1000, the exact count will be
  obtained anyway via the super call.

* We're using [`EXPLAIN`](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/explain.html)
  to get MySQL to return the approximate count. This returns a tabular analysis
  of the query execution plan - including an estimate of the number of rows
  that will be searched (it may be quite a bit off, I've seen +-50% in the
  wild). More on `EXPLAIN` below.

* The query has a comment in it - this is good practice for any custom SQL as
  it makes the `slow_log` and other query digests easy to link back to the part
  in the app that made the query.

* The exact count will still be obtained with the super call if the query is
  any more complex than `MyModel.objects.count()`. This code is just the first
  stage of optimization to remove the worst `SELECT COUNT(*)` queries - most
  other queries the ORM generates should be able to narrow the count down using
  an index if you've gotten your index design right.


Why use `EXPLAIN` and not `SHOW TABLE STATUS` as in Avian's blog? Because
`EXPLAIN` can be used to extract more detailed counts using index reads as well
- an extension left for the reader (i.e. I haven't needed this yet). But here's
an example MySQL session showing that `EXPLAIN`ing a simple WHERE clause on an
indexed column can extract an approximate count too. It's only 100% accurate in
this case because this table is small (from the example
[sakila database](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/)):

```sql
mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE sakila.city\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: city
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `city` (
  `city_id` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `city` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `country_id` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `last_update` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`city_id`),
  KEY `idx_fk_country_id` (`country_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `fk_city_country` FOREIGN KEY (`country_id`) REFERENCES `country` (`country_id`) ON UPDATE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=601 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sakila.city WHERE country_id = 23\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
COUNT(*): 53
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sakila.city WHERE country_id = 23\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: city
         type: ref
possible_keys: idx_fk_country_id
          key: idx_fk_country_id
      key_len: 2
          ref: const
         rows: 53
        Extra: Using index
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```


My second step in this fix this was to make sure this only applied in Django's
admin area, and couldn't affect any logic in other parts of the app which might
rely on exact counts. This is easy enough if you're using a custom admin base
class for every `Admin` class in your app:


```python
class MySuperDuperAdmin(Admin):
    def queryset(self, request):
        qs = super(MySuperDuperAdmin, self).queryset(request)
        qs = qs._clone(klass=ApproxCountQuerySet)
        return qs
```


The final step was a cosmetic fix to make sure the approximate nature of the
counts is reported to admin users - we wouldn't want anyone misquoting ballpark
numbers as exact, would we? A quick hack can make sure that if the approximate
count is used, the templates all say 'Approximately N'. Replacing lines at the
end of `ApproxCountQuerySet.count`:

```python
            if n >= 1000:
                return ApproximateInt(n)
        else:
            return super(ApproxCountQuerySet, self).count()


class ApproximateInt(int):
    def __str__(self):
        return 'Approximately ' + super(ApproximateInt, self).__str__()
```

And here's what the final product looks like at the top of an admin page:

Ta-daa!
